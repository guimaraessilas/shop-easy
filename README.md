## Features

The project emulates an online store and includes the following features:

1. **Authentication**: Allows the user to log in using credentials. Implemented with React Query, Zustand, SecureAsyncStore, and Axios to manage state, HTTP requests, and caching.

2. **Product List**: Displays a list of available products. Implemented using Expo Router navigation, which organizes the app's pages.

3. **Product Editing**: Allows the user to edit the details of a specific product by clicking on it in the list.

4. **Product Addition**: Allows the user to add new products to the store.

5. **Local Session Storage**: Uses Zustand to maintain the logged-in user's state and React Query to manage data caching, providing a smooth experience.
